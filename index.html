      <p>Wolf is the second studio album by American rapper Tyler, the Creator. It was released on April 2, 2013, by Odd Future Records and RED Distribution. Wolf contains the elements that set Tyler's musical style in a different direction compared to his other materials such as Bastard (2009) and Goblin (2011) respectively, which featured more violent content, while the album features a more production based sound and different themes. The album features guest appearances from Mike G, Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Left Brain, Hodgy Beats, Erykah Badu and Pharrell, among others. The album was produced by Tyler, the Creator himself, except for the final track.</p>
